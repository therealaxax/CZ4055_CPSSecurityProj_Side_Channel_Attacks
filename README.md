# CZ4055_CPSSecurityProj_Side_Channel_Attacks

<p> scaproj.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the code for generating the different plots according to the project requirements (which may take a while). The first set of graphs uses correlation power analysis (CPA) on a set number of power traces (100) to recover individual key bytes. The second set of graphs uses CPA on a varying number of traces (10, 20, 30 ... 100) to demonstrate how the accuracy of CPA increases as an increasing number of power traces is used to generate the correlation values. </p>

## anotherownwaveform.csv
<p> anotherownwaveform.csv is a csv file containing the power traces and plaintext/ciphertext pairs we used for CPA. </p>

## scaproj.pdf
<p> scaproj.pdf contains the code used in pdf format, with the plots already generated. </p>

## CZ4055_SCA_Project_Report.docx
<p> CZ4055_SCA_Project_Report.docx contains our project report. </p>
